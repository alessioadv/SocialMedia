My experience with the Social app:
I built a fully functional social media app leveraging the power of React for a dynamic and responsive user interface. Thanks to TypeScript, I was able to develop with strong type safety. Prisma and PostgreSQL provide powerful and scalable data management, while Tailwind CSS made the design quick and customizable. Clerk simplified user authentication with a secure system, and Next.js made routing and page generation perfect for SEO. Finally, using ShadCN further enriched the interface, making the app user-friendly and modern!
